# You want to say "Thank You"?

I'm developing and maintaining this package in my spare time. And I've released 
it under and OpenSource License so you can freely use it.

If you want to thank me for that, feel free to have a look at my 
[Wishlist](https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/1J6GL8WQM6713) and send me a gift.

I'm also always happy to hear about what cool projects you've build with this 
package. So if you want to drop me a message and tell me that'd be cool!
